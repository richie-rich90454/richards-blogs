                <h2>Well... Who am I?</h2>
                <p>I am Richard Jiang. I would say I am a student, and I would probably consider my self to be a person who is rather interested in a few topics, including science (chemistry  and some fields of physics and biology), computer science (both hardware and software), and social studies (history). I often dive deep into such topics in my non-cirricular times, and I really enjoy being an expert in a certain field.</p>
                <h2>Okay... Who are your friends?</h2>
                <p>My friends are often like me. My friends are also experts of "niches", and we often become friends due to our same interest in an area. For instance, many friends I had in Middle School were known by me due to them either being knowledgable of computers (computer science) or aviation (fluid dynamics are a key part of aviation, and fluid dynamics are an integral part of physics).</p>
